# Writing and publishing user docs

The user docs are written in [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Install `mkdocs` and then you can do the following:

While writing the docs, to preview locally:

```
 $ mkdocs serve
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
INFO    -  The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in the "nav" configuration:
  - index.md

[I 191218 10:16:33 handlers:135] Browser Connected: http://127.0.0.1:8000/intro/

```

When you're done and have committed the changes, then you can publish it:

```
$ mkdocs gh-deploy
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
