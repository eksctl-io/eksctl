# Writing and publishing user docs

The user docs are written in [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Install `mkdocs` and then you can do the following:

While writing the docs, to preview locally:

```console
 $ make serve-pages
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
INFO    -  The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in the "nav" configuration:
  - index.md
