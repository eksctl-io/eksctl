	//	AmazonProvidedDNS. To specify multiple domain name servers in a single
	//	parameter, separate the IP addresses using commas. To have your instances
	//	receive custom DNS hostnames as specified in domain-name , you must specify a

	//
	//	- ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to eight Network Time Protocol (NTP)
	//	servers (four IPv4 addresses and four IPv6 addresses).
	//
	//	- netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.
	//
	//	- netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that
	//	you specify 2. Broadcast and multicast are not supported. For more information
	//	about NetBIOS node types, see [RFC 2132].
	//
	//	- ipv6-address-preferred-lease-time - A value (in seconds, minutes, hours, or
	//	years) for how frequently a running instance with an IPv6 assigned to it goes
	//	through DHCPv6 lease renewal. Acceptable values are between 140 and 2147483647

	// increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party

	// RunInstances is subject to both request rate limiting and resource rate

	//   - The StartDeclarativePoliciesReport API can only be called by the management

	//
	//   - Trusted access must be enabled for the service for which the declarative
	//     policy will enforce a baseline configuration. If you use the Amazon Web Services
	//     Organizations console, this is done automatically when you enable declarative
	//     policies. The API uses the following service principal to identify the EC2
	//     service: ec2.amazonaws.com . For more information on how to enable trusted
	//     access with the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon Web Services SDKs, see [Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services]in
	//     the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide.
