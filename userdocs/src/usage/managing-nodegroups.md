# Managing nodegroups

You can add one or more nodegroups in addition to the initial nodegroup created along with the cluster.

To create an additional nodegroup, use:

```
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName> [--name=<nodegroupName>]
```

!!!note
    By default, new nodegroups inherit the version from the control plane (`--version=auto`), but you can specify a different
    version e.g. `--version=1.10`, you can also use `--version=latest` to force use of whichever is the latest version.

Additionally, you can use the same config file used for `eksctl create cluster`:

```
eksctl create nodegroup --config-file=<path>
```

If there are multiple nodegroups specified in the file, you can select
a subset via `--include=<glob,glob,...>` and `--exclude=<glob,glob,...>`:

```
eksctl create nodegroup --config-file=<path> --include='ng-prod-*-??' --exclude='ng-test-1-ml-a,ng-test-2-?'
```

### Creating a nodegroup from a config file

Nodegroups can also be created through a cluster definition or config file. Given the following example config file
and an existing cluster called ``dev-cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: dev-cluster
  region: eu-north-1

nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1-workers
    labels: { role: workers }
    instanceType: m5.xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 10
    volumeSize: 80
    privateNetworking: true
  - name: ng-2-builders
    labels: { role: builders }
    instanceType: m5.2xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 2
    volumeSize: 100
    privateNetworking: true
```

The nodegroups `ng-1-workers` and `ng-2-builders` can be created with this command:

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup --config-file=dev-cluster.yaml
```

If you have already prepared for attaching existing classic load balancers or/and target groups to the nodegroups,
you can specify these in the config file. The classic load balancers or/and target groups are automatically associated with the ASG when creating nodegroups.

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: dev-cluster
  region: eu-north-1

nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1-web
    labels: { role: web }
    instanceType: m5.xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 10
    privateNetworking: true
    classicLoadBalancerNames:
      - dev-clb-1
      - dev-clb-2
    asgMetricsCollection:
      - granularity: 1Minute
        metrics:
          - GroupMinSize
          - GroupMaxSize
          - GroupDesiredCapacity
          - GroupInServiceInstances
          - GroupPendingInstances
          - GroupStandbyInstances
          - GroupTerminatingInstances
          - GroupTotalInstances
  - name: ng-2-api
    labels: { role: api }
    instanceType: m5.2xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 2
    privateNetworking: true
    targetGroupARNs:
      - arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:eu-north-1:01234567890:targetgroup/dev-target-group-1/abcdef0123456789
```

### Listing nodegroups

To list the details about a nodegroup or all of the nodegroups, use:

```
eksctl get nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName> [--name=<nodegroupName>]
```

### Nodegroup immutability

By design, nodegroups are immutable. This means that if you need to change something (other than scaling) like the
AMI or the instance type of a nodegroup, you would need to create a new nodegroup with the desired changes, move the
load and delete the old one. Check [Deleting and draining](#deleting-and-draining).

### Scaling

A nodegroup can be scaled by using the `eksctl scale nodegroup` command:

```
eksctl scale nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName> --nodes=<desiredCount> --name=<nodegroupName> [ --nodes-min=<minSize> ] [ --nodes-max=<maxSize> ]
```

For example, to scale nodegroup `ng-a345f4e1` in `cluster-1` to 5 nodes, run:

```
eksctl scale nodegroup --cluster=cluster-1 --nodes=5 ng-a345f4e1
```

If the desired number of nodes is `NOT` within the range of current minimum and current maximum nodes, one specific error will be shown.
Kindly note that these values can also be passed with flags `--nodes-min` and `--nodes-max` respectively.

Scaling a nodegroup works by modifying the nodegroup CloudFormation stack via a ChangeSet.

!!!note
    Scaling a nodegroup down/in (i.e. reducing the number of nodes) may result in errors as we rely purely on changes to the ASG. This means that the node(s) being removed/terminated aren't explicitly drained. This may be an area for improvement in the future.

You can also enable SSH, ASG access and other feature for each particular nodegroup, e.g.:

```
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=cluster-1 --node-labels="autoscaling=enabled,purpose=ci-worker" --asg-access --full-ecr-access --ssh-access
```

### Update labels

There are no specific commands in `eksctl`to update the labels of a nodegroup but that can easily be achieved using
`kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl label nodes -l alpha.eksctl.io/nodegroup-name=ng-1 new-label=foo
```

### Deleting and draining

To delete a nodegroup, run:

```
eksctl delete nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName> --name=<nodegroupName>
```

!!!note
    This will drain all pods from that nodegroup before the instances are deleted.

All nodes are cordoned and all pods are evicted from a nodegroup on deletion,
but if you need to drain a nodegroup without deleting it, run:

```
eksctl drain nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName> --name=<nodegroupName>
```

To uncordon a nodegroup, run:

```
eksctl drain nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName> --name=<nodegroupName> --undo
```

### Nodegroup selection in config files

To perform a create or delete operation on only a subset of the nodegroups specified in a config file, there are two
CLI flags: `include` and `exclude`. These accept a list of globs such as `ng-dev-*`, for example.

Using the example config file above, one can create all the workers nodegroup except the workers one with the following
command:

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup --config-file=dev-cluster.yaml --exclude=ng-1-workers
```

Or one could delete the builders nodegroup with:

```bash
eksctl delete nodegroup --config-file=dev-cluster.yaml --include=ng-2-builders --approve
```

In this case, we also need to supply the `--approve` command to actually delete the nodegroup.
