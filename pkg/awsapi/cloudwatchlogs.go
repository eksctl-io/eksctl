	// When you use AssociateKmsKey , you specify either the logGroupName parameter or
	// the resourceIdentifier parameter. You can't specify both of those parameters in
	// the same operation.
	//
	//   - Specify the logGroupName parameter to cause all log events stored in the log
	//     group to be encrypted with that key. Only the log events ingested after the key
	//     is associated are encrypted with that key.
	//
	// Associating a KMS key with a log group overrides any existing associations
	//
	//	between the log group and a KMS key. After a KMS key is associated with a log
	//	group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the KMS key.
	//	This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is
	//	still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data
	//	whenever it is requested.
	//
	// Associating a key with a log group does not cause the results of queries of
	//
	//	that log group to be encrypted with that key. To have query results encrypted
	//	with a KMS key, you must use an AssociateKmsKey operation with the
	//	resourceIdentifier parameter that specifies a query-result resource.
	//
	//	- Specify the resourceIdentifier parameter with a query-result resource, to
	//	use that key to encrypt the stored results of all future [StartQuery]operations in the
	//	account. The response from a [GetQueryResults]operation will still return the query results in
	//	plain text.
	//
	// Even if you have not associated a key with your query results, the query
	//
	//	results are encrypted when stored, using the default CloudWatch Logs method.
	//
	// If you run a query from a monitoring account that queries logs in a source
	//
	//	account, the query results key from the monitoring account, if any, is used.
	//
	// If you delete the key that is used to encrypt log events or log group query
	// results, then all the associated stored log events or query results that were
	// encrypted with that key will be unencryptable and unusable.
	//
	// CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do not use an associate an

	//
	// To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services service and

	//
	//   - Create a delivery destination, which is a logical object that represents

	//   - If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use [PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy]in the destination
	//     account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery
	//     to that destination.
	//
	//   - Use CreateDelivery to create a delivery by pairing exactly one delivery
	//     source and one delivery destination.
	//
	// You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple
	// destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple

	// algorithms to scan log events and find patterns.
	//
	// A pattern is a shared text structure that recurs among your log fields.
	// Patterns provide a useful tool for analyzing large sets of logs because a large

	// # Data protection policy
	//
	// A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested by
	// your log groups by auditing and masking the sensitive log data. Each account can
	// have only one account-level data protection policy.
	//
	// Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into a log group.
	// When you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log groups
	// before that time are not masked.
	//
	// If you use PutAccountPolicy to create a data protection policy for your whole
	// account, it applies to both existing log groups and all log groups that are
	// created later in this account. The account-level policy is applied to existing
	// log groups with eventual consistency. It might take up to 5 minutes before
	// sensitive data in existing log groups begins to be masked.
	//
	// By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the
	// sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the logs:Unmask
	// permission can use a [GetLogEvents]or [FilterLogEvents] operation with the unmask parameter set to true to
	// view the unmasked log events. Users with the logs:Unmask can also view unmasked
	// data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query
	// with the unmask query command.
	//
	// For more information, including a list of types of data that can be audited and
	// masked, see [Protect sensitive log data with masking].
	//
	// To use the PutAccountPolicy operation for a data protection policy, you must be
	// signed on with the logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy
	// permissions.
	//
	// The PutAccountPolicy operation applies to all log groups in the account. You
	// can use [PutDataProtectionPolicy]to create a data protection policy that applies to just one log group.
	// If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an
	// account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any
	// sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.
	//
	// # Subscription filter policy
	//
	// A subscription filter policy sets up a real-time feed of log events from
	// CloudWatch Logs to other Amazon Web Services services. Account-level
	// subscription filter policies apply to both existing log groups and log groups
	// that are created later in this account. Supported destinations are Kinesis Data
	// Streams, Firehose, and Lambda. When log events are sent to the receiving
	// service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.
	//
	// The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:
	//
	//   - An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription
	//     policy, for same-account delivery.
	//
	//   - An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for
	//     same-account delivery.
	//
	//   - A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for
	//     same-account delivery.
	//
	//   - A logical destination in a different account created with [PutDestination], for
	//     cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as
	//     logical destinations.
	//
	// Each account can have one account-level subscription filter policy per Region.
	// If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in
	// PolicyName . To perform a PutAccountPolicy subscription filter operation for
	// any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the iam:PassRole
	// permission.
	//
	// # Transformer policy
	//
	// Creates or updates a log transformer policy for your account. You use log
	// transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier
	// for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different
	// sources into standardized formats that contain relevant, source-specific
	// information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs this
	// transformation at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the
	// transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with
	// CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filters.
	//
	// You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log
	// events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name,
	// account ID and Region.
	//
	// A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor
	// applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log
	// group. For more information about the available processors to use in a
	// transformer, see [Processors that you can use].
	//
	// Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your
	// applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch
	// Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box
	// transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources such as VPC
	// flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation
	// templates or create custom transformation policies.
	//
	// You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class.
	//
	// You can have one account-level transformer policy that applies to all log
	// groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level transformer
	// policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the
	// selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple account-level transformer
	// policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping
	// log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log
	// groups that start with my-log , you can't have another field index policy
	// filtered to my-logpprod or my-logging .
	//
	// You can also set up a transformer at the log-group level. For more information,
	// see [PutTransformer]. If there is both a log-group level transformer created with PutTransformer
	// and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log
	// group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level
	// transformer.
	//
	// # Field index policy
	//
	// You can use field index policies to create indexes on fields found in log
	// events in the log group. Creating field indexes can help lower the scan volume
	// for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those fields, because these
	// queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match
	// the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query
	// for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log
	// events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, user IDs, or
	// instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs]
	//
	// To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the [GetLogGroupFields] operation.
	//
	// For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId . Then, any
	// CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId =
	// value or requestId in [value, value, ...] will attempt to process only the log
	// events where the indexed field matches the specified value.
	//
	// Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For
	// example, an indexed field of RequestId won't match a log event containing
	// requestId .
	//
	// You can have one account-level field index policy that applies to all log
	// groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level field index
	// policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the
	// selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple account-level index policies
	// with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log
	// group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups
	// that start with my-log , you can't have another field index policy filtered to
	// my-logpprod or my-logging .
	//
	// If you create an account-level field index policy in a monitoring account in
	// cross-account observability, the policy is applied only to the monitoring
	// account and not to any source accounts.
	//
	// If you want to create a field index policy for a single log group, you can use [PutIndexPolicy]
	// instead of PutAccountPolicy . If you do so, that log group will use only that
	// log-group level policy, and will ignore the account-level policy that you create
	// with [PutAccountPolicy].

	// events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and
	// instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs].
	//
	// To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the [GetLogGroupFields] operation.
	//
	// For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId . Then, any
	// CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId =
	// value or requestId IN [value, value, ...] will process fewer log events to
	// reduce costs, and have improved performance.
	//
	// Each index policy has the following quotas and restrictions:
	//
	//   - As many as 20 fields can be included in the policy.
	//
	//   - Each field name can include as many as 100 characters.

	// Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For

	// Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch Logs
	// resource. Currently, the only CloudWatch Logs resources that can be tagged are
	// log groups and destinations.
	//
	// Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them
	// to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only
	// resources with certain tag values.
	//
	// Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted
	// strictly as strings of characters.
	//
	// You can use the TagResource action with a resource that already has tags. If
	// you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of
	// tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already
	// associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the
	// previous value for that tag.
	//
