# Default add-on updates

!!! warning "New for 2024"
    eksctl now installs default addons as EKS addons instead of self-managed addons. Read more about its implications in [Cluster creation flexibility for default networking addons](#cluster-creation-flexibility-for-default-networking-addons).

!!! warning "New for 2024"
    For updating addons, `eksctl utils update-*` cannot be used for clusters created with eksctl v0.184.0 and above.
    This guide is only valid for clusters created before this change.

There are 3 default add-ons that get included in each EKS cluster:
- `kube-proxy`
- `aws-node`
- `coredns`

???+ info
    For official EKS addons that are created manually through `eksctl create addons` or upon cluster creation, the way to manage them is
    through `eksctl create/get/update/delete addon`. In such cases, please refer to the docs about [EKS Add-Ons](https://eksctl.io/usage/addons/).

The process for updating each of them is different, hence there are 3 distinct commands that you will need to run.

???+ info
    All of the following commands accept `--config-file`.

???+ note
    By default each of these commands runs in plan mode, if you are happy with the proposed changes, re-run with `--approve`.

To update `kube-proxy`, run:

```
eksctl utils update-kube-proxy --cluster=<clusterName>
```

To update `aws-node`, run:

```
eksctl utils update-aws-node --cluster=<clusterName>
```

To update `coredns`, run:

```
eksctl utils update-coredns --cluster=<clusterName>
```

Once upgraded, be sure to run `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` and check if all addon pods are in ready state, you should see
something like this:

```
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
aws-node-g5ghn             1/1     Running   0          2m
aws-node-zfc9s             1/1     Running   0          2m
coredns-7bcbfc4774-g6gg8   1/1     Running   0          1m
coredns-7bcbfc4774-hftng   1/1     Running   0          1m
kube-proxy-djkp7           1/1     Running   0          3m
kube-proxy-mpdsp           1/1     Running   0          3m
```
