# Customizing kubelet configuration

System resources can be reserved through the configuration of the kubelet. This is recommended, because in the case 
of resource starvation the kubelet might not be able to evict pods and eventually make the node become `NotReady`. To
 do this, config files can include the `kubeletExtraConfig` field which accepts a free form yaml that will be embedded 
 into the `kubelet.yaml`.

 
Some fields in the `kubelet.yaml` are set by eksctl and therefore are not overwritable, such as the `address`, 
`clusterDomain`, `authentication`, `authorization`, `serverTLSBootstrap` or `featureGates`. 

The following example config file creates a nodegroup that reserves `300m` vCPU, `300Mi` of memory and `1Gi` of 
ephemeral-storage for the kubelet; `300m` vCPU, `300Mi` of memory and `1Gi`of ephemeral storage for OS system 
daemons; and kicks in eviction of pods when there is less than `200Mi` of memory available or less than  10% of the 
root filesystem.

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: dev-cluster-1
  region: eu-north-1

nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1
    instanceType: m5a.xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 1
    kubeletExtraConfig:
        kubeReserved:
            cpu: "300m"
            memory: "300Mi"
            ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
        kubeReservedCgroup: "/kube-reserved"
        systemReserved:
            cpu: "300m"
            memory: "300Mi"
            ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
        evictionHard:
            memory.available:  "200Mi"
            nodefs.available: "10%"
```

In this example, given instances of type `m5a.xlarge` which have 4 vCPUs and 16GiB of memory, the `Allocatable` amount
 of CPUs would be 3.4 and 15.4 GiB of memory.
