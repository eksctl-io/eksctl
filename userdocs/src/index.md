# `eksctl` - The official CLI for Amazon EKS

sponsored by [![Weaveworks](img/weaveworks.svg#inline)](https://www.weave.works/) and built by [![Contributors](img/gophers.png#inline)](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/graphs/contributors) on [![Github](img/octocat.svg#inline)](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)

`eksctl` is a simple CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS - Amazon's new managed Kubernetes service for EC2.
It is written in Go, uses CloudFormation, was created by [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/) and it welcomes
contributions from the community. Create a basic cluster in minutes with just one command:

 <h2 id="intro-code">
```console
eksctl create cluster
```
</h2>

A cluster will be created with default parameters:

- exciting auto-generated name, e.g., `fabulous-mushroom-1527688624`
- two `m5.large` worker nodes—this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money
- use the official AWS [EKS AMI](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami)
- `us-west-2` region
- a dedicated VPC (check your quotas)
- using static AMI resolver

Example output:

```
$ eksctl create cluster

Customize your cluster by using a config file. Just run

```
eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml
```

to apply a `cluster.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: basic-cluster
  region: eu-north-1

nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1
    instanceType: m5.large
    desiredCapacity: 10
  - name: ng-2
    instanceType: m5.xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 2
```

Once you have created a cluster, you will find that cluster credentials were added in `~/.kube/config`. If you have
`kubectl` v1.10.x as well as `aws-iam-authenticator` commands in your PATH, you should be
able to use `kubectl`. You will need to make sure to use the same AWS API credentials for this also. Check
[EKS docs][ekskubectl] for instructions. If you installed `eksctl` via Homebrew, you should have all of these
dependencies installed already.

To learn more about how to create clusters and other features continue reading the
[usage section](usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/).
