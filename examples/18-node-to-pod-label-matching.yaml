# This example demonstrates how to force the spawning of 
# certain pods to a desired node group.
# 
# Pre-requisites
# In order for this sample to work, the pod's deployment file
# should contain the following yaml property.
# 
# spec:
#   containers:
#     - ...omitted for brevity
#   nodeSelector:
#     node-class: "compute-intensive-node"
#
# Setting labels could be very useful as they allow you to
# design an infrastructure that is suited for an app's use-case.
