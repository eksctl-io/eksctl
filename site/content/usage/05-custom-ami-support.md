### Latest & Custom AMI Support

With the 0.1.2 release we have introduced the `--node-ami` flag for use when creating a cluster. This enables a number of advanced use cases such as using a custom AMI or querying AWS in realtime to determine which AMI to use (non-GPU and GPU instances).

The `--node-ami` can take the AMI image id for an image to explicitly use. It also can take the following 'special' keywords:

| Keyword | Description |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| static       | Indicates that the AMI images ids embedded into `eksctl` should be used. This relates to the static resolvers. |
| auto        | Indicates that the AMI to use for the nodes should be found by querying AWS. This relates to the auto resolver. |

If, for example, AWS release a new version of the EKS node AMIs and a new version of `eksctl` hasn't been released you can use the latest AMI by doing the following:

```
eksctl create cluster --node-ami=auto
```

With the 0.1.9 release we have introduced the `--node-ami-family` flag for use when creating the cluster. This makes it possible to choose between different officially supported EKS AMI families.

The `--node-ami-family` can take following keywords:

| Keyword | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AmazonLinux2 | Indicates that the EKS AMI image based on Amazon Linux 2 should be used. (default)|
| Ubuntu1804 | Indicates that the EKS AMI image based on Ubuntu 18.04 should be used. |

<!-- TODO for 0.3.0
To use more advanced configuration options, [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api):

```
eksctl apply --cluster-config advanced-cluster.yaml
```
