# `eksctl` - a CLI for Amazon EKS

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/eksctl/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/eksctl/tree/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/weaveworks/eksctl/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/weaveworks/eksctl?branch=master) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)

`eksctl` is a simple CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS - Amazon's new managed Kubernetes service for EC2. It is written in Go, uses CloudFormation, and is maintained by [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/). Create a basic cluster in minutes with just one command :

 <h2 id="code">**`eksctl create cluster`**</h2>

A cluster will be created with default parameters

> ∙ exciting auto-generated name, e.g. "fabulous-mushroom-1527688624"

> ∙ 2x `m5.large` nodes (this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money)

> ∙ use official AWS EKS AMI

> ∙ `us-west-2` region

> ∙ dedicated VPC (check your quotas)

> ∙ using static AMI resolver

Customize your cluster by using a config file. Just run

```
eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml
```

to apply a `cluster.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: basic-cluster
  region: eu-north-1

nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1
    instanceType: m5.large
    desiredCapacity: 10
    ssh:
      allow: true # will use ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub as the default ssh key
  - name: ng-2
    instanceType: m5.xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 2
    ssh:
      publicKeyPath: ~/.ssh/ec2_id_rsa.pub
```

Once you have created a cluster, you will find that cluster credentials were added in `~/.kube/config`. If you have `kubectl` v1.10.x as well as `aws-iam-authenticator` commands in your PATH, you should be
able to use `kubectl`. You will need to make sure to use the same AWS API credentials for this also. Check [EKS docs][ekskubectl] for instructions. If you installed `eksctl` via Homebrew, you should have all of these dependencies installed already.
