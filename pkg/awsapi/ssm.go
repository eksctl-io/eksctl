	// Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are
	// metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed nodes,
	// maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags
	// enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by
	// purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
	// value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for
	// your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack
	// level. For example:
	//   - Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin
	//   - Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin
	//   - Key=Owner,Value=Dev
	//   - Key=Stack,Value=Production
	//   - Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production
	//   - Key=Stack,Value=Test
	//
	// Most resources can have a maximum of 50 tags. Automations can have a maximum of
	// 5 tags. We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for
	// each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you
	// to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the
	// tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted

	// ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service.
	// This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of
	// a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the
	// account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service
	// team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use
	// this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in
	// for a paid feature. Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. Amazon
	// Web Services services teams define the default value for a SettingId . You can't
	// create a new SettingId , but you can overwrite the default value if you have the
	// ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the GetServiceSetting
	// API operation to view the current value. Or, use the ResetServiceSetting to
	// change the value back to the original value defined by the Amazon Web Services
	// service team. Update the service setting for the account.
