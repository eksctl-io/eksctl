// RoleMapping is a mapping of an AWS Role ARN to a Kubernetes username and a
// list of Kubernetes groups. The username and groups are specified as templates
// that may optionally contain two template parameters:
//
//  1) "{{AccountID}}" is the 12 digit AWS ID.
//  2) "{{SessionName}}" is the role session name.
//
// The meaning of SessionName depends on the type of entity assuming the role.
// In the case of an EC2 instance role this will be the EC2 instance ID. In the
// case of a federated role it will be the federated identity (controlled by the
// federated identity provider). In the case of a role assumed directly with
// sts:AssumeRole it will be user controlled.
//
// You can use plain values without parameters to have a more static mapping.
