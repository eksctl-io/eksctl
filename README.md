# `eksctl` - The official CLI for Amazon EKS

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/eksctl/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/eksctl/tree/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/weaveworks/eksctl/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/weaveworks/eksctl?branch=master) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/weaveworks/eksctl)

`eksctl` is a simple CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS - Amazon's new managed Kubernetes service for EC2. It is written in Go, and uses CloudFormation.

You can create a cluster in minutes with just one command – **`eksctl create cluster`**!

## Installation

To download the latest release, run:

```
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/latest_release/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
```

Alternatively, macOS users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
brew tap weaveworks/tap
brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl
```

and Windows users can use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org):

```
chocolatey install eksctl
```

You will need to have AWS API credentials configured. What works for AWS CLI or any other tools (kops, Terraform etc), should be sufficient. You can use [`~/.aws/credentials` file][awsconfig]
or [environment variables][awsenv]. For more information read [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html).

[awsenv]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html
[awsconfig]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html

You will also need [AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator) command (either `aws-iam-authenticator` or `aws eks get-token` (available in version 1.16.156 or greater of AWS CLI) in your `PATH`.

## Basic usage

To create a basic cluster, run:

```
eksctl create cluster
```

A cluster will be created with default parameters

- exciting auto-generated name, e.g. "fabulous-mushroom-1527688624"
- 2x `m5.large` nodes (this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money)
- use official AWS EKS AMI
- `us-west-2` region
- dedicated VPC (check your quotas)
- using static AMI resolver

Once you have created a cluster, you will find that cluster credentials were added in `~/.kube/config`. If you have `kubectl` v1.10.x as well as `aws-iam-authenticator` commands in your PATH, you should be
able to use `kubectl`. You will need to make sure to use the same AWS API credentials for this also. Check [EKS docs][ekskubectl] for instructions. If you installed `eksctl` via Homebrew, you should have all of these dependencies installed already.
