# TODOs

- [] Rewrite in Go (or maybe Python, as AWS CLI extension)
- [] Cluster API subset would be nice
- [] Maybe use nested CloudFormation stack and make it really one step CloudFormation generator (or something like that)
- [] Maybe make it a fork of kops (intially to use API infra, later use node bootsrap, add linuxkit nodes)
- [] Ensure to add a timer
- [] Call home (and mention in the readme) - time, cluster type, regios, IP (or hash of) [no need to count delitions]
