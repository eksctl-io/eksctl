# An example ClusterConfig that creates the EKS control plane on AWS Outposts.
# Since the VPC will be created by eksctl, it will lack connectivity to the API server because eksctl does not
# associate the VPC with the local gateway. Therefore, the command must be run with `--without-nodegroup`, as in
# `eksctl create cluster -f examples/35-outposts.yaml --without-nodegroup`, and the nodegroups can be created after
# ensuring connectivity to the API server.
