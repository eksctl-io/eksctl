	// When you use AssociateKmsKey , you specify either the logGroupName parameter or
	// the resourceIdentifier parameter. You can't specify both of those parameters in
	// the same operation.
	//
	//   - Specify the logGroupName parameter to cause log events ingested into that
	//     log group to be encrypted with that key. Only the log events ingested after the
	//     key is associated are encrypted with that key.
	//
	// Associating a KMS key with a log group overrides any existing associations
	//
	//	between the log group and a KMS key. After a KMS key is associated with a log
	//	group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the KMS key.
	//	This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is
	//	still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data
	//	whenever it is requested.
	//
	// Associating a key with a log group does not cause the results of queries of
	//
	//	that log group to be encrypted with that key. To have query results encrypted
	//	with a KMS key, you must use an AssociateKmsKey operation with the
	//	resourceIdentifier parameter that specifies a query-result resource.
	//
	//	- Specify the resourceIdentifier parameter with a query-result resource, to
	//	use that key to encrypt the stored results of all future [StartQuery]operations in the
	//	account. The response from a [GetQueryResults]operation will still return the query results in
	//	plain text.
	//
	// Even if you have not associated a key with your query results, the query
	//
	//	results are encrypted when stored, using the default CloudWatch Logs method.
	//
	// If you run a query from a monitoring account that queries logs in a source
	//
	//	account, the query results key from the monitoring account, if any, is used.
	//
	// If you delete the key that is used to encrypt log events or log group query
	// results, then all the associated stored log events or query results that were
	// encrypted with that key will be unencryptable and unusable.
	//
	// CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do not associate an

	//
	// To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services service and

	//   - Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the
	//     resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information, see [PutDeliverySource].
	//
	//   - Create a delivery destination, which is a logical object that represents

	//
	//   - If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use [PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy]in the destination
	//     account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery
	//     to that destination.
	//
	//   - Use CreateDelivery to create a delivery by pairing exactly one delivery
	//     source and one delivery destination.
	//
	// You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple
	// destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple
	// deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same

	// Creates an anomaly detector that regularly scans one or more log groups and

	// algorithms to scan log events and find patterns. A pattern is a shared text
	// structure that recurs among your log fields. Patterns provide a useful tool for
	// analyzing large sets of logs because a large number of log events can often be
	// compressed into a few patterns.
	//
	// The anomaly detector uses pattern recognition to find anomalies , which are
	// unusual log events. It uses the evaluationFrequency to compare current log
	// events and patterns with trained baselines.

	//
	// # Data protection policy
	//
	// A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested by
	// your log groups by auditing and masking the sensitive log data. Each account can
	// have only one account-level data protection policy.
	//
	// Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into a log group.
	// When you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log groups
	// before that time are not masked.
	//
	// If you use PutAccountPolicy to create a data protection policy for your whole
	// account, it applies to both existing log groups and all log groups that are
	// created later in this account. The account-level policy is applied to existing
	// log groups with eventual consistency. It might take up to 5 minutes before
	// sensitive data in existing log groups begins to be masked.
	//
	// By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the
	// sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the logs:Unmask
	// permission can use a [GetLogEvents]or [FilterLogEvents] operation with the unmask parameter set to true to
	// view the unmasked log events. Users with the logs:Unmask can also view unmasked
	// data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query
	// with the unmask query command.
	//
	// For more information, including a list of types of data that can be audited and
	// masked, see [Protect sensitive log data with masking].
	//
	// To use the PutAccountPolicy operation for a data protection policy, you must be
	// signed on with the logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy
	// permissions.
	//
	// The PutAccountPolicy operation applies to all log groups in the account. You
	// can use [PutDataProtectionPolicy]to create a data protection policy that applies to just one log group.
	// If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an
	// account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any
	// sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.
	//
	// # Subscription filter policy
	//
	// A subscription filter policy sets up a real-time feed of log events from
	// CloudWatch Logs to other Amazon Web Services services. Account-level
	// subscription filter policies apply to both existing log groups and log groups
	// that are created later in this account. Supported destinations are Kinesis Data
	// Streams, Firehose, and Lambda. When log events are sent to the receiving
	// service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.
	//
	// The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:
	//
	//   - An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription
	//     policy, for same-account delivery.
	//
	//   - An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for
	//     same-account delivery.
	//
	//   - A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for
	//     same-account delivery.
	//
	//   - A logical destination in a different account created with [PutDestination], for
	//     cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as
	//     logical destinations.
	//
	// Each account can have one account-level subscription filter policy per Region.
	// If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in
	// PolicyName . To perform a PutAccountPolicy subscription filter operation for
	// any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the iam:PassRole
	// permission.
	//
	// # Transformer policy
	//
	// Creates or updates a log transformer policy for your account. You use log
	// transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier
	// for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different
	// sources into standardized formats that contain relevant, source-specific
	// information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs this
	// transformation at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the
	// transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with
	// CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filters.
	//
	// You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log
	// events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name,
	// account ID and Region.
	//
	// A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor
	// applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log
	// group. For more information about the available processors to use in a
	// transformer, see [Processors that you can use].
	//
	// Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your
	// applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch
	// Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box
	// transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources such as VPC
	// flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation
	// templates or create custom transformation policies.
	//
	// You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class.
	//
	// You can have one account-level transformer policy that applies to all log
	// groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level transformer
	// policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the
	// selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple account-level transformer
	// policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping
	// log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log
	// groups that start with my-log , you can't have another transformer policy
	// filtered to my-logpprod or my-logging .
	//
	// You can also set up a transformer at the log-group level. For more information,
	// see [PutTransformer]. If there is both a log-group level transformer created with PutTransformer
	// and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log
	// group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level
	// transformer.
	//
	// # Field index policy
	//
	// You can use field index policies to create indexes on fields found in log
	// events for a log group or data source name and type combination. Creating field
	// indexes can help lower the scan volume for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that
	// reference those fields, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of
	// log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index
	// are fields that you often need to query for and fields or values that match only
	// a small fraction of the total log events. Common examples of indexes include
	// request ID, session ID, user IDs, or instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs]
	//
	// To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the [GetLogGroupFields] operation. To
	// find the fields for a data source use the [GetLogFields]operation.
	//
	// For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId . Then, any
	// CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId =
	// value or requestId in [value, value, ...] will attempt to process only the log
	// events where the indexed field matches the specified value.
	//
	// Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For
	// example, an indexed field of RequestId won't match a log event containing
	// requestId .
	//
	// You can have one account-level field index policy that applies to all log
	// groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level field index
	// policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups using LogGroupNamePrefix
	// with the selectionCriteria parameter. You can have another 20 account-level
	// field index policies using DataSourceName and DataSourceType for the
	// selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple account-level index policies
	// with LogGroupNamePrefix selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or
	// overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy
	// filtered to log groups that start with my-log, you can't have another field
	// index policy filtered to my-logpprod or my-logging. Similarly, if you have
	// multiple account-level index policies with DataSourceName and DataSourceType
	// selection criteria, no two of them can use the same data source name and type
	// combination. For example, if you have one policy filtered to the data source
	// name amazon_vpc and data source type flow you cannot create another policy with
	// this combination.
	//
	// If you create an account-level field index policy in a monitoring account in
	// cross-account observability, the policy is applied only to the monitoring
	// account and not to any source accounts.
	//
	// CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the
	// Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the
	// following fields:
	//
	//   - @logStream
	//
	//   - @aws.region
	//
	//   - @aws.account
	//
	//   - @source.log
	//
	//   - @data_source_name
	//
	//   - @data_source_type
	//
	//   - @data_format
	//
	//   - traceId
	//
	//   - severityText
	//
	//   - attributes.session.id
	//
	// CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for certain data source name and
	// type combinations as well. Default field indexes are automatically available for
	// the following data source name and type combinations as identified in the
	// following list:
	//
	//	  amazon_vpc.flow
	//
	//	- action
	//
	//	- logStatus
	//
	//	- region
	//
	//	- flowDirection
	//
	//	- type
	//
	//	  amazon_route53.resolver_query
	//
	//	- transport
	//
	//	- rcode
	//
	//	  aws_waf.access
	//
	//	- action
	//
	//	- httpRequest.country
	//
	// aws_cloudtrail.data , aws_cloudtrail.management
	//
	//   - eventSource
	//
	//   - eventName
	//
	//   - awsRegion
	//
	//   - userAgent
	//
	//   - errorCode
	//
	//   - eventType
	//
	//   - managementEvent
	//
	//   - readOnly
	//
	//   - eventCategory
	//
	//   - requestId
	//
	// Default field indexes are in addition to any custom field indexes you define
	// within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted towards your [field index quota].
	//
	// If you want to create a field index policy for a single log group, you can use [PutIndexPolicy]
	// instead of PutAccountPolicy . If you do so, that log group will use that
	// log-group level policy and any account-level policies that match at the data
	// source level; any account-level policy that matches at the log group level (for
	// example, no selection criteria or log group name prefix selection criteria) will
	// be ignored.
	//
	// # Metric extraction policy
	//
	// A metric extraction policy controls whether CloudWatch Metrics can be created
	// through the Embedded Metrics Format (EMF) for log groups in your account. By
	// default, EMF metric creation is enabled for all log groups. You can use metric
	// extraction policies to disable EMF metric creation for your entire account or
	// specific log groups.
	//
	// When a policy disables EMF metric creation for a log group, log events in the
	// EMF format are still ingested, but no CloudWatch Metrics are created from them.
	//
	// Creating a policy disables metrics for AWS features that use EMF to create
	// metrics, such as CloudWatch Container Insights and CloudWatch Application
	// Signals. To prevent turning off those features by accident, we recommend that
	// you exclude the underlying log-groups through a selection-criteria such as
	// LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/containerinsights",
	// "/aws/ecs/containerinsights", "/aws/application-signals/data"] .
	//
	// Each account can have either one account-level metric extraction policy that
	// applies to all log groups, or up to 5 policies that are each scoped to a subset
	// of log groups with the selectionCriteria parameter. The selection criteria
	// supports filtering by LogGroupName and LogGroupNamePrefix using the operators IN
	// and NOT IN . You can specify up to 50 values in each IN or NOT IN list.
	//
	// The selection criteria can be specified in these formats:
	//
	//	LogGroupName IN ["log-group-1", "log-group-2"]
	//
	//	LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/prefix1", "/aws/prefix2"]
	//
	// If you have multiple account-level metric extraction policies with selection
	// criteria, no two of them can have overlapping criteria. For example, if you have
	// one policy with selection criteria LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["my-log"] , you can't
	// have another metric extraction policy with selection criteria
	// LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["/my-log-prod"] or LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["/my-logging"]
	// , as the set of log groups matching these prefixes would be a subset of the log
	// groups matching the first policy's prefix, creating an overlap.
	//
	// When using NOT IN , only one policy with this operator is allowed per account.
	//
	// When combining policies with IN and NOT IN operators, the overlap check ensures
	// that policies don't have conflicting effects. Two policies with IN and NOT IN
	// operators do not overlap if and only if every value in the IN policy is
	// completely contained within some value in the NOT IN policy. For example:
	//
	//   - If you have a NOT IN policy for prefix "/aws/lambda" , you can create an IN
	//     policy for the exact log group name "/aws/lambda/function1" because the set of
	//     log groups matching "/aws/lambda/function1" is a subset of the log groups
	//     matching "/aws/lambda" .
	//
	//   - If you have a NOT IN policy for prefix "/aws/lambda" , you cannot create an
	//     IN policy for prefix "/aws" because the set of log groups matching "/aws" is
	//     not a subset of the log groups matching "/aws/lambda" .

	// Creates or updates a field index policy for the specified log group. Only log

	// information about log classes, see [Log classes].
	//
	// You can use field index policies to create field indexes on fields found in log
	// events in the log group. Creating field indexes speeds up and lowers the costs
	// for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those field indexes, because
	// these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not
	// match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to
	// query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log
	// events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and
	// instance IDs. For more information, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs].
	//
	// You can configure indexed fields as facets to enable interactive exploration
	// and filtering of your logs in the CloudWatch Logs Insights console. Facets allow
	// you to view value distributions and counts for indexed fields without running
	// queries. When you create a field index, you can optionally set it as a facet to
	// enable this interactive analysis capability. For more information, see [Use facets to group and explore logs].
	//
	// To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the [GetLogGroupFields] operation.
	//
	// For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId . Then, any
	// CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId =
	// value or requestId IN [value, value, ...] will process fewer log events to
	// reduce costs, and have improved performance.
	//
	// CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the
	// Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the
	// following fields:
	//
	//   - @logStream
	//
	//   - @aws.region
	//
	//   - @aws.account
	//
	//   - @source.log
	//
	//   - traceId
	//
	// Default field indexes are in addition to any custom field indexes you define
	// within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted towards your field
	// index quota.
	//
	// Each index policy has the following quotas and restrictions:
	//
	//   - As many as 20 fields can be included in the policy.
	//
	//   - Each field name can include as many as 100 characters.
	//
	// Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For
	// example, a field index of RequestId won't match a log event containing requestId
	// .
	//
