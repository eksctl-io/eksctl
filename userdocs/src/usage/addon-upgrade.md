# Default add-on updates

There are 3 default add-ons that get included in each EKS cluster, the process for updating each of them is different, hence
there are 3 distinct commands that you will need to run.

!!!info
    All of the following commands accept `--config-file`.

!!!note
    By default each of these commands runs in plan mode, if you are happy with the proposed changes, re-run with `--approve`.

To update `kube-proxy`, run:

```
eksctl utils update-kube-proxy --cluster=<clusterName>
```

To update `aws-node`, run:

```
eksctl utils update-aws-node --cluster=<clusterName>
```

To update `coredns`, run:

```
eksctl utils update-coredns --cluster=<clusterName>
```

Once upgraded, be sure to run `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` and check if all addon pods are in ready state, you should see
something like this:

```
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
aws-node-g5ghn             1/1     Running   0          2m
aws-node-zfc9s             1/1     Running   0          2m
coredns-7bcbfc4774-g6gg8   1/1     Running   0          1m
coredns-7bcbfc4774-hftng   1/1     Running   0          1m
kube-proxy-djkp7           1/1     Running   0          3m
kube-proxy-mpdsp           1/1     Running   0          3m
```
